# starship

This project is a Coding Challange done for the role of Sr. iOS Developer for Transurban. 

Basically, This app fetchs a single page of the Starship details from the given API. 

While the API call is being made, a loading indicator is shown

If for some reason, the API call fails, It shows a generic error message

On successful API call, the data is listed in a normal order as we get in the response, with options to favourite or view the details of each item. User can simply click on `Add To Favourite` button to favourite an item either from the list or from the detail screen. once the item is added to favourite list, the `Add To Favourite` button is changed to highlighted `Favourite` button.

You also have an option to view all the favourite items from the top right navigation bar button. On this Favourite screen, you will see the similar behaviour with options to add to remove any favourite item or view the details.
